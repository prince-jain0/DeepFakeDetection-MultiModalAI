        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>In an era where digital manipulation is becoming increasingly sophisticated, deepfake videos pose a serious threat to information integrity, privacy, and security. Our project is designed to detect deepfake videos by analyzing both audio and visual components to distinguish between authentic and manipulated content.

            How it Works?
            Visual Analysis: Our model examines facial expressions, inconsistencies in lighting, and frame distortions to identify artificially generated elements.
            Audio Analysis: The system detects anomalies in speech patterns, mismatched lip synchronization, and unnatural sound modulations.
            Combined Deepfake Detection: By aligning both audio and video using techniques like Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and deep learning models, our system provides an accurate deepfake detection result.
            User-Friendly Interface: The platform allows users to simply upload a video, and the AI-powered system processes it to determine whether it is real or fake.
            This technology is crucial in combating misinformation, ensuring media authenticity, and preventing malicious usage of deepfake videos in scams, identity theft, and political propaganda.</p>

        <h2>What is Deepfake?</h2>
        <p>Deepfakes are AI-generated synthetic media where a personâ€™s appearance, voice, or actions are manipulated using machine learning techniques, making it appear as though they said or did something they never actually did. These deceptive videos can be used in:

            Fake News & Misinformation: Deepfakes are often used to spread false information, leading to confusion and manipulation of public opinion.
            Cybersecurity Threats: Hackers can use deepfake technology to impersonate individuals, leading to identity theft, fraud, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.
            Political Manipulation: Deepfakes can be used to falsely depict politicians or public figures, potentially disrupting elections or public trust.
            Personal Privacy Violations: Individuals can be targeted through manipulated videos, leading to harassment or reputational damage.
            Why is Detection Critical?
            With the rise of AI-generated content, identifying deepfakes is essential to maintaining trust in digital media. Our system leverages cutting-edge AI and machine learning techniques to detect and prevent the spread of deepfake content before it causes harm.</p>
