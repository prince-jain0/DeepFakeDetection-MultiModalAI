# DeepFakeDetection-MultiModalAI
This project is an AI-powered deepfake detection system that analyzes both visual and audio features to determine whether a video is real or fake. Using EfficientNet-B0 for image processing and Wav2Vec2.0 for audio analysis, our model employs cross-attention fusion to improve deepfake classification accuracy.
